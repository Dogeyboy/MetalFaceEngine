# The MetalFace Engine
A 3D engine created purely with Metal and Objective-C (originally C)

## Goal of the engine
The goals of this engine are follows:
- Be able to create a 3D game out of this engine
- Visually improve the engine
- Maintain Metal code within the engine without sacrificing it to other graphics libraries such as Vulkan

## Why MetalFace?
The reasons as to why MetalFace is because I want to be able to make a FPS game akin to Quake and made natively from Mac.
